							The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is
							the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and
							the largest and most massive relative to its parent
							planet,[f] with a diameter about one-quarter that of
							Earth (comparable to the width of Australia).[16]
							The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a
							differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite
							planet under the geophysical definitions of the term
							and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar
							System.[17] It lacks any significant atmosphere,
							hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity
							is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with
							Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in the
							Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity
							and density.
						</div>
						<div>
							The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of
							384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's
							diameter. Its gravitational influence is the main
							driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens
							Earth's day. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a
							sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic
							period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface
							illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%,
							resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for
							the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally
							locked to Earth, which means that the length of a
							full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its
							same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and
							the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the
							synodic period. However, 59% of the total lunar
							surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical
							shifts in perspective known as libration.
						</div>
						<div>
							The most widely accepted origin explanation posits
							that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not
							long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant
							impact between the planet and a hypothesized
							Mars-sized body called Theia. It then receded to a
							wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the
							Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark
							volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces
							between bright ancient crustal highlands and
							prominent impact craters. Most of the large impact
							basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of
							the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago.
							The lunar surface is fairly non-reflective, with the
							reflectance of lunar soil being comparable to that
							of asphalt. However, due to its large angular
							diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial
							object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is
							nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to
							cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar
							eclipse.
						</div>
						<div>
							Both the Moon's prominence in Earth's sky and its
							regular cycle of phases have provided cultural
							references and influences for human societies
							throughout history. Such influences can be found in
							language, calendar systems, art, and mythology. The
							first artificial object to reach the Moon was the
							Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959;
							this was followed by the first successful soft
							landing by Luna 9 in 1966. The only human lunar
							missions to date have been those of the United
							States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on
							the surface between 1969 and 1972. These and later
							uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have
							been used to develop a detailed geological
							understanding of the Moon's origins, internal
							structure, and subsequent history.
